miR-island
==========

an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for plant miRNA annotation

Next-generation sequencing of small RNAs have provided rich information on microRNAs profile of various plant species. However, few computational tools are presently available to analyze these data effectively. MiR-island is a local tool that analyzes plant small RNAs and quantifies small RNA genes. In this study, miR-island performs unprecedented speed and efficient memory-usage in plant microRNA annotations.
